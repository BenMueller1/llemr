Hello Volunteers and Coordinators,

You're recieving this email because it looks like you logged into Osler in the last 16 days, meaning you were potentially affected by a bug that caused some frustration.

As a result of an update allowing users to choose the units they measured vital signs in, we had an issue where, if the user forgot to specify units the form, the app would just bounce the form back without any explanation. (Bad!) This lead people to think that the form couldn't be submitted at all. This was an oversight of mine (Justin's).

This issue has now been fixed, and when units aren't specified for a vital signs reading, that field should be highlighted in red like any other form validation error.

I'm just writing to thank everyone for their patience and adaptability when things aren't working as they should. We try to make sure that there aren't ever any show-stoppers like this, but (obviously) aren't always successful.

As an aside, anytime anyone has any feedback for us on Osler--including true bugs like this one, but also just suggestions for improvement--my ears are always open. We strive to be continuously improving (as much as we can with an all-volunteer staff, anyway), and would love to hear your feedback. The new unit-choice feature was, in fact, the suggestion of one of my very own classmates, Tom Hong.

Anyway, thanks for volunteering at the SNHC!

Cheers,
Justin
